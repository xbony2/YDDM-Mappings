# YDDM-Mappings
An attempt to making Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters for GBA moddable.

By reading this information, I assume you:
* Own a physical unpirated ROM cartridge of Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters, for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance Game Boy Advance].
* Own a physical unpirated handhold Nintendo video game console that can run the such ROM cartridge, such as the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance Game Boy Advance] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite Nintendo DS Lite].

If you do not own the above, please do not read my information. You can easily buy the Dungeon Dice Monsters game off of Ebay for 2-10$, and an Game Boy Advance for 15-50$.
