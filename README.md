# YDDM-Mappings
An attempt to making Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters for GBA moddable.

By reading this information, I assume you:

1. Own a physical unpirated ROM cartridge of Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters, for the [Game Boy Advance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).

2. Own a physical unpirated handhold Nintendo video game console that can run the such ROM cartridge, such as the [Game Boy Advance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) or [Nintendo DS Lite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite).

If you do not own the above, please do not read my information/documentation. You can easily buy the Dungeon Dice Monsters game off of Ebay for 2-10$, and an Game Boy Advance for 15-50$.

# Resources
Tools I'm using:

* An Emulater. I'm using the [Boycott Advance](http://boycottadvance.emuunlim.org). You should only use an emulater if you have completed assumption #2. I personally own a DS Lite that can run Game Boy Advance-based games.

* A ROM image of YDDM. You can find one simply by googling it. Remember, you should only download one if you have completed assumption #1. I've owned a YDDM cartridge for a long time; I've battled (and beaten) Yami-Yugi at least a dozen times.

* A Hexeditor. Right now, I'm using [Hex Fiend](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/). It's open sourced, fast, awesome, etc.

* A patch handler. Distributing the entire ROM image can get you into legal awkwardness. Although YDDM is quite old and built on hardware no longer supported by Nintendo, it's better to do the right thing. I use [MultiPatch](http://projects.sappharad.com/tools/multipatch.html).

* A Git Client. I personally use [Egit](http://eclipse.org/egit/) for the Eclipse IDE, which doubles as a Markdown IDE and Ruby IDE for making various tools.

* YToolKit. Yes, that's in this repository.

* Wine. This is for OS X and Linux computers to be able to run Windows programs. Works about half the time.

* GBATA. Adds a bunch of cool GBA tools.

All of these work on OS X. That's because I personally use OS X. Windows stuff might work.
