# YDDM-Mappings
An attempt to making Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters for GBA moddable.

By reading this information, I assume you:

* Own a physical unpirated ROM cartridge of Yu-Gi-Oh Dungeon Dice Monsters, for the [Game Boy Advance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).

* Own a physical unpirated handhold Nintendo video game console that can run the such ROM cartridge, such as the [Game Boy Advance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) or [Nintendo DS Lite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite).

If you do not own the above, please do not read my information. You can easily buy the Dungeon Dice Monsters game off of Ebay for 2-10$, and an Game Boy Advance for 15-50$.
